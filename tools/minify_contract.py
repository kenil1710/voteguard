"""
Strips a GenLayer contract down to what the chain actually needs to execute.

Bradbury refuses deploys somewhere between 48 KB and 64 KB of source, and
`contracts/proof_work.py` is 156 KB. Just under half of that is comments,
docstrings and blank lines — bytes that cost real deploy payload and buy the
chain nothing. This produces the deployable artifact while the readable source
stays in git, so nothing is lost from the repository.

Deliberately conservative. Every transformation below preserves Python
semantics exactly; none of them rename anything, reorder anything, or touch a
single expression. Identifier mangling would shrink it further and is not done
here, because a contract whose behaviour depends on an LLM reading its own
prompt strings is a bad place to be clever.

    python3 tools/minify_contract.py contracts/proof_work.py -o build/proof_work.min.py

What it removes:
  - comments (except the runner header on line 1, which the VM requires)
  - docstrings, at module, class and function level
  - blank lines
  - trailing whitespace
  - indentation beyond one space per level

What it never touches:
  - line 1, byte for byte
  - any string that is not a docstring — prompt templates included
  - the order or content of any statement

    1. **Docstrings** — the first statement of a module, class or function.
    2. **Attribute docstrings** (PEP 258) — a string placed *after* a constant
       to document it. This contract uses that idiom heavily and it accounts
       for ~24 KB, more than the docstrings proper.

    triple-quoted strings that are *values* (prompt templates above all), and
