/**
 * Shared helpers for the VoteGuard integration scripts.
 *
 * Lifted from the proven Sentinel harness. The retry, nudge and outcome logic
 * is unchanged: it encodes several networks worth of hard-won knowledge about
 * how Studionet and Bradbury each report a revert, and rewriting it would mean
 * relearning all of it.
 *
 * The important one is `outcomeOf`. Studionet and Bradbury report a revert in
 * DIFFERENT PLACES, and reading the wrong one turns every failed transaction
 * into a silent pass:
 *
 *   - Bradbury sets `tx.txExecutionResultName` to "FINISHED_WITH_ERROR".
 *   - Studionet leaves `txExecutionResultName` UNDEFINED and records the real
 *     outcome at `tx.consensus_data.leader_receipt[0].execution_result`
 *     ("SUCCESS" | "ERROR").
 *
 * A check written against `txExecutionResultName` alone reads `undefined !==
 * "FINISHED_WITH_ERROR"` on Studionet and reports success for a transaction
 * that reverted and rolled back. That cost a false pass on the u128 storage
 * gate before this helper existed.
